### Motivation

The Canadian University Software Engineering Conference, henceforth referred to as CUSEC, aims to unite students from all over Canada to participate in workshops and talks in the field of software. The conference is also an opportunity for students to network with professionals in the field.

The absence of an efficient data management system can greatly impact the efficiency of the logistics team in charge of organizing this event. It is key that the information is accessible to certain parties as soon as it is updated in one place. Witnessing this real-life issue is a main driver for the unique project choice.

### Scope

The requirements of the system are shaped to tackle the two main following issues:

- *Scheduling different types of events in locations at specific times*  
CUSEC engages students in many different types of events requiring rooms.
It is important to schedule these properly to avoid conflicts.

- *Distributing workload for organizers of the event*  
For efficiency, assigning work to organizers would minimize errors and foster collaboration. When planning events like these, a lot of small tasks may add up. Keeping track of these becomes a must.

These are achieved through the storage of specific data, as described in the data requirements, and require certain operations to be executed, as described in the functional requirements of the analysis.
